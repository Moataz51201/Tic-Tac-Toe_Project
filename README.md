# Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Symmetric States, and Heuristic Reduction

This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python with an AI opponent that uses the minimax algorithm, alpha-beta pruning, symmetric states, and heuristic reduction for efficient decision-making.

## Features

- Classic Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay.
- AI opponent using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
- Symmetric states to reduce computation by considering equivalent game states.
- Heuristic reduction for faster evaluation of game states.
Run the game and play Tic-Tac-Toe against the AI opponent.
Make your moves by clicking on the game board.
The AI opponent will use the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make strategic moves.
The AI opponent is implemented using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for optimal move selection.

Symmetric states are generated to reduce the search space by considering reflections and rotations of the game board as equivalent.

Heuristic reduction is applied to speed up the evaluation of game states
